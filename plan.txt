##### OVERVIEW #####

A multi-part application that allows the user to view YouTube and/or Twitch VODs for ESports.
Other channels can be selected but it is targetted at ESports. 

The user should be able to add channels that they frequently watch. 

There may be a separate tab/apps for Twitch/YouTube (like a 'switch to YT' btn).


##### PAGES #####

Consider the difference between home and subs page, and whether these might be combined, where search bar is present on all pages save for maybe the player.

--- Home ---
Land here on first load
Should have a search bar for channels and videos (lower priority)
Should have quick links to your subscribed channels
Should NOT have any recommended, or other video thumbnails

--- Subscriptions ---
View your subscribed channels
Should NOT show videos from subscribed channels (spoiler reasons)
Consider 'last uploaded' date under each channels

--- Channel ---
An important page; shows a channel's uploads
 - Date-filtered content (e.g. do not display any videos released after XX:XX on YYYY-MM-DD)
 - Thumbnail blurring or blocking completely?
 - Potential title modifcation

Critically, it cannot show all videos on load. It must be selective loading controlled by the user
Allows the user to unsubscribe

--- Watch ---
The centerpiece page. A custom video player with anti-spoiler features
 - Custom playback controls with no video duration
 - No comments or recommended videos (in sidebar or on video pause/end)
 - Centered design with theatre mode, and full-screen mode
 - Ability to toggle live chat (if possible)
 - Ability to optionally toggle comments
Should have channel details under video, and consider description as well (with optional toggling)

--- Account ---
Should have user details
Should offer the user options to change/update details
Should offer option to delete account

--- Search Results ---
Should display channel search results 
Unsure about video searching feature at this stage - perhaps a toggle for this


##### KEY COMPONENTS / DESIGN #####

Twitch layout will be heavy inspiration. Minimal features:
 - Logo top left
 - User dropdown menu top right
 - Search bar likely top middle on select pages
 - A right-side menu may not be of significant use here. At most thumbnail icons of subscribed channels, potentially those with recent uploads?


##### FEATURES #####

Optional additions features
 - A browser extension that lets the user open any Twitch/YT link in this app instead
 - Notifications of new videos from their 'subscribed' channels



TESTING
Consider using Playwright for browser end-to-end testing!
